## ðŸ¤¦ TL; DR

- Styled jsx

- Basic Syntax

---

## Styled-jsx

It is a **CSS-in-JS library** that allows you to write encapsulated and scoped CSS to style your components. \[See source 1] 

The styles you introduce for one component **won't affect other components**, allowing you to add, change and delete styles **without worrying about unintended side effects**. \[See source 2]

### Basic Syntax - Style Components

With the following basic syntax, you can style components just as the way you do with CSS.

```jsx
<style jsx>{`
	.some_class {
		...
	}
`}</style>
```

---

### Basic Syntax - Style Globally

Basically, styled-jsx is scoped to style the elements but you can still style them globally.

```jsx
<style jsx>{`
	.some_class {
		...
	}
`}</style>
```
