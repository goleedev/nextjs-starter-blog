## With History Object

If trying to pass props using history object, you can pass them as follows:

```js
const history = useHistory();

history.push({
  pathname: '/search',
  search: `?query=${searchInput}`,
  state: { data: searchInput }
}
```

## With Link Component

If trying to pass props using history object, you can pass them as follows:

```js
<Link to={{
  pathname: '/template',
  search: '?query=abc',
  state: { detail: response.data }
  }}>
	My Link 
</Link>
```
