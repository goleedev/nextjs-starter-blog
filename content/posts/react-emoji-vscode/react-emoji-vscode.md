## React Emoji

If you don't want any **ESLint fail messages**, it is recommended to use `<span>` tags for emojis on React as follows: \[See Source 1]

```jsx
<span aria-label="a rocket blasting off" role="img">ðŸš€</span>
```

But, it is certainly not the easiest and quickest way to use emojis on your app.

### :emojisense:

If you are using VSCode, you can install **:emojisense: extension** to use emojis.

Once you install it, you can type `:anything:` to find your emoji of choice.
