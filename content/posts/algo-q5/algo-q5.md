## Data Structures & Algorithms

A computer program is **a collection of instructions to perform a specific task**. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.

A **data structure** is a named location that can be used to **store and organize data**. 

And, an **algorithm** is a collection of **steps to solve a particular problem**. \[See Source 1]

### Question 5 Instruction

Write a solution to return a **JadenCase string**.

Remember that the following strings from the capitalized letter should be in lower case.

##### I/O Examples
