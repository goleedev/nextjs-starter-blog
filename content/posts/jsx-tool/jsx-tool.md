## ðŸ¤¦ TL; DR

â€‹	Personally, I do not really use these tools because sometimes it is harder  to modify what is transformed than **typing on my own.**

- JSX

- HTML to JSX

- SVG to JSX

## [JSX](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

According to React documents, JSX is a **syntax extension** to JavaScript. 

They recommend using it with React to describe **what the UI should look like**. 

JSX looks like a template language buy it comes with the **full power of JavaScript**.
